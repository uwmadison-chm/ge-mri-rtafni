#### Tools to enable realtime fMRI data monitoring on GE scanners

If you came to town looking for a special-purpose software package, you sure have come to the right place. This is a little package to enable monitoring fMRI data collection from GE's MRI scanners, using AFNI's Dimon and viewer. It might work with other kinds of scanners, too; it'll really depend on whether Dimon likes your dicoms.

This was developed at and for the Waisman Laboratory for Brain Imaging at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison. It might be useful other places, too. But I'm not very likely to help you make it work.

There are two main components to this:

### Scanner console uploader

This is designed to have a minimal footprint on the running scanner. It uses inotify (really, pyinotify) to watch for incoming files in the dicom store and copy them to an NFS-mounted directory on the data upload host.

The program you'll run on the scanner console is `realtime_dicom_copy`:

```
Realtime DICOM copier.

Usage:
  realtime_dicom_copy.py <watch_dir> <dest_dir> [options]

Options:
  -h --help               Show this screen
  --version               Show version information
  -v --verbose            Show lots of logging information
  --filter-module=<mod>   [default: is_dicom] This must be the name of a
                          python module that implements a filter() method.
                          This method will take a filename and return a
                          dicom dataset or None/False.
```

See `is_dicom.py` and `fmri_dicom.py` in the `scanner-console` directory to see how the filters work.

For us, the command `realtime_dicom_copy.py /export/home1/sdc_image_pool/images /mri-upload/rtafni --filter=fmri_dicom` starts things working nicely.


### Data upload host

This does some More Stuff.

The basic idea here is that we watch an incoming directory (and all subdirs) for new files. When we get one:

* Is it a dicom? If not, ignore it. Otherwise...
* Stop watching the directory this file came into.
* From the dicom, determine the number of frames and slices per frame
* Kick off the viewer script (see `upload-host/bash/rtafni.sh`)

The script you're using here is `upload-host/realtime_monitor.py`:

```
Watch for DICOM series and start a realtime viewer. Probably realtime AFNI.

Usage:
  realtime_monitor.py <watch_path> <realtime_script> [options]

Options:
  -h --help
  -v --verbose

realtime_script will be called with three arguments:
  The path to the DICOM series
  The number of expected slices per frame
  The number expected frames
```

`upload-host/bash/rtafni.sh` is a pretty good stab at a `realtime_script`.

Remember that because of the Magic of X11, your upload host need not be the computer you're viewing the data on.

### Dependencies and credits

Requires python 2.6. Probably won't work with 3.x.
